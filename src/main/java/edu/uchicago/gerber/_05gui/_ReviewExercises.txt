R10.5 Events
An event object encapsulates information about a state change or an action that has occurred.It contains details
about the event. For example, in a mouse click event, the event object might contain information about the mouse's x
and y coordinates, which mouse button was clicked, how many times it was clicked, etc.
In Java's Swing library, you'll find event classes like ActionEvent, MouseEvent, KeyEvent, and many others.
An event source is the object on which the event occurs.
It's responsible for generating an event. For instance, a button in a GUI might be an event source for click events.
When a user clicks the button, the button generates (or "fires") an event.
Event sources have mechanisms to register and unregister event listeners (i.e., they keep track of which objects want
to be notified when a particular event occurs).
An event listener is an interface (or often an object implementing a specific interface) that defines methods which
will be invoked in response to certain events.
It "listens" for specific types of events and defines what action should be taken when such an event occurs.
In Java's Swing, listeners are often defined by interfaces with methods that need to be overridden.
For instance, the ActionListener interface has the actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) method, which gets called
when an action event (like a button click) happens.You attach listeners to sources. For instance, you might add
an ActionListener to a JButton so that when the button is clicked, the actionPerformed method of the listener is called.

R10.6 actionPerformed
Who calls the actionPerformed method?
The Swing or AWT event dispatching system calls the actionPerformed method.
When a user interacts with a GUI component that has an associated ActionListener (like pressing a button),
the component generates an ActionEvent. The event dispatching system then notifies all registered ActionListeners
by calling their actionPerformed method, passing the ActionEvent as an argument.
When does the call to the actionPerformed method occur?
The call to the actionPerformed method occurs when an action event is generated by a GUI component. Here are some scenarios when this can happen:
A button is pressed.
A menu item is selected.
A timer fires (if you're using a javax.swing.Timer).
A user presses Enter in a text field (assuming the text field has an action listener registered).
Any other component-specific action event occurs for components that support action listeners.

R10.11 Inner class and event-listeners
Inner classes, particularly anonymous inner classes, are frequently used in Java for event listeners
because they provide a concise and readable way to define and instantiate a listener directly in the
context where it's needed. They allow for direct access to the instance variables and methods of the
enclosing class, making it easy to modify the GUI or perform actions based on events without the need
for extra method calls or parameter passing.

However, if Java did not have inner classes, we could still implement event listeners.
Here are a few alternative approaches:
1. Separate Top-level Classes: We could define each listener as its own top-level class.
Each of these classes would need to implement the appropriate listener interface.
If these listeners need access to instance variables or methods of the main GUI class,
we would have to pass a reference to the main GUI class to the listener (typically via a constructor).
2. Use Lambdas (Java 8 and above): With the introduction of lambdas in Java 8,
event handling can be even more concise for functional interfaces.

R10.14 Object hierarchies
Method Declared in JTextArea:

append(String str): This method appends the given String to the end of the document of the JTextArea.
Method that JTextArea Inherits from JTextComponent:
setSelectedText(String text): This method replaces the currently selected content with the new text.
Method that JTextArea Inherits from JComponent:
setToolTipText(String text): This method sets the text that is displayed when the cursor hovers over the component (creating a tooltip).

R10.22 Graphic methods
We can do the modification in the following way:
public void drawFlagWithWhiteCenter(Graphics g, int xLeft, int yTop, int width, Color leftColor, Color rightColor){
    // Draw the left color
    g.setColor(leftColor);
    g.fillRect(xLeft, yTop, width/3, width*2/3);

    // Draw the white center
    g.setColor(Color.WHITE);
    g.fillRect(xLeft + width/3, yTop, width/3, width*2/3);

    // Draw the right color
    g.setColor(rightColor);
    g.fillRect(xLeft + 2*width/3, yTop, width/3, width*2/3);
}

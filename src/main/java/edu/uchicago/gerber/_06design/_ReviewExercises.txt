R12.1 OO Analysis and Design
1. Recognize how to discover classes and their responsibilities.
2. Categorize class relationships and produce UML diagrams that describe them.
3. Apply an object-oriented development process to designing a program.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
R12.2 OO Analysis and Design
Rule of Thumb: Consider nouns in the problem domain.
Problem Statement Analysis: Read through the requirements or problem statement. Underline or highlight nouns and noun
phrases. These often represent potential classes.
Granularity: Not every noun becomes a class. Filter out based on significance to the problem. For example, in a
banking system, "Account" might be a class while "Paper" might not.
Grouping & Abstraction: Group related nouns together. If several nouns seem to be related, they might belong to the
same class or be part of a hierarchy. For instance, "Savings Account" and "Checking Account" can both be subclasses
of "Account".
External Interactions: Consider external systems or entities that the system interacts with. These might also be
represented as classes, even if they're outside the system (e.g., "PaymentGateway").



-------------------------------------------------------------------------
R12.3 OO Analysis and Design
Finding Methods:
Rule of Thumb: Consider verbs or actions associated with the identified classes.
Problem Statement Analysis: Read through the requirements or problem statement again. This time, underline or
highlight verbs and verb phrases. These often represent potential methods or operations.
Class-Action Association: Associate the identified actions with the classes they operate on or are most closely related to. For example, "deposit" and "withdraw" are actions associated with the "Account" class.
CRUD Operations: For many classes, especially those representing entities in a system, consider if you'll need basic
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations as methods.
Consistency & Completeness: Ensure that the methods identified cover all the required functionalities and are
consistent with the responsibilities of the class. It's important that a class doesn't become a "god object" with too
many responsibilities, and that each method clearly aligns with the class's purpose.
Remember, these rules of thumb are starting points. As you gain experience and delve deeper into object-oriented
design principles and patterns, you'll refine your intuition for identifying classes and methods. Always be open to
revisiting and refactoring your design as you understand the problem better.
